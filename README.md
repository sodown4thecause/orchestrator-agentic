# Orchestra: Multi-Agent Workflow Platform

## Vision
Orchestra is a next-generation, enterprise-grade platform for building, orchestrating, and managing multi-agent AI workflows. It combines the power of stateful, intelligent agents with the transparency and flexibility of a graph-based workflow engine, all deployed as scalable, containerized microservices.

## Core Architecture
- **Hybrid Agent-Graph Model:** Explicit, observable workflow graphs orchestrate stateful agents.
- **Microservices:** Decoupled services (API Gateway, Maestro Service, Workflow Engine, Agent Runtime, Integration Service) communicate via REST APIs.
- **Polyglot Persistence:** PostgreSQL (workflow state), Redis (agent state), Qdrant/Weaviate (vector search).
- **Universal Toolbelt:** Secure, Pydantic-based framework for integrating external APIs (Slack, Salesforce, Notion, Discord, Google, Twitter, etc.) with OAuth 2.0 authentication and centralized credential management.
- **NLP-Driven Workflow Generation:** The Maestro agent translates natural language goals into executable workflow graphs.

## System Components
- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all traffic, handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Maestro Service:** Converts natural language goals into workflow graphs.
- **Workflow Engine:** Executes workflow graphs, manages run state, orchestrates agents.
- **Agent Runtime:** Executes OrchestraAgent instances, manages agent state.
- **Integration Service:** Centralizes third-party API/tool integrations and credential management.
- **State & Vector Stores:**
  - PostgreSQL: Workflow/run state, logs, audit.
  - Redis: Agent short-term memory.
  - Qdrant/Weaviate: Vector search for RAG.

## Key Data Models
- **OrchestraAgent:** Python class, stateful, prep -> exec -> post lifecycle, configurable via Pydantic.
- **Workflow Graph:** Declarative YAML/JSON, defines nodes (agents), edges (transitions), actions (conditions).
- **Context Object:** Shared dictionary for each workflow run, passed between agents.
- **Tool:** Pydantic-defined, validated, and discoverable via the Universal Toolbelt.

## Core Features
- **Graph-based workflow execution (DAG, parallel/conditional paths)**
- **Stateful agent runtime with SDK**
- **NLP-driven workflow generation (Maestro)**
- **Integration marketplace (Slack, Salesforce, Notion, etc.)**
- **Collaborative multi-agent RAG pipeline**
- **Observability dashboard (tracing, logs, cost, metrics)**
- **RBAC and security best practices**

## API Endpoints (v1.0)
- `POST /v1/workflows` — Create/update workflow definition
- `POST /v1/workflows/generate` — Generate workflow from natural language
- `POST /v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/run` — Trigger workflow run
- `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}` — Get run status/history/result
- `GET /v1/runs` — List workflow runs
- `GET /v1/agents` — List available agent templates
- `GET /v1/tools` — List available tools
- `POST /v1/integrations/oauth/start` — Start OAuth for new integration

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant/Weaviate
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry

## Development Roadmap
1. **MVP:** Core engine, agent runtime, state management, Slack integration, end-to-end test.
2. **Multi-Agent & RAG:** Parallel execution, collaborative RAG agents, Notion/Salesforce integrations.
3. **NLP & Enterprise:** Maestro service/UI, observability dashboard, cost tracking, RBAC, security hardening.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd orchestrator-agentic
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. See each microservice directory for local run instructions.
3. Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests in `/k8s` for local orchestration.
