## üé® Using the Platform

### Creating Your First Workflow

1. **Open the Workflow Builder**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Create Workflow" or navigate to "New Workflow"

2. **Describe Your Automation**
   Try these examples:
   ```
   "When someone fills out my contact form, send them a welcome email and add them to my CRM"
   
   "Every Monday at 9 AM, create a summary of last week's GitHub issues and post it to our Slack channel"
   
   "When a new order comes in Stripe, add the customer to Mailchimp and create a task in ClickUp"
   ```

3. **Review and Configure**
   - The AI will parse your description into workflow steps
   - Review the generated workflow
   - Configure service connections and settings

4. **Test and Deploy**
   - Test the workflow with sample data
   - Activate it to start running automatically

### Setting Up Integrations

1. **Go to Integrations Page**
   - View all available services
   - See connection status for each

2. **Connect a Service**
   - Click "Connect" on any service
   - Provide API keys or OAuth credentials
   - Test the connection

3. **Use in Workflows**
   - Connected services appear in workflow builder
   - AI automatically suggests relevant services

### Managing MCP Containers

1. **Add a Container**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí MCP Containers
   - Add Docker image URL
   - Configure capabilities

2. **Start/Stop Containers**
   - Manage container lifecycle
   - View logs and health status

3. **Use in Workflows**
   - MCP containers appear as available services
   - Execute custom AI tools and processors

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Backend (.env)
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/agentic-workflow-builder
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
